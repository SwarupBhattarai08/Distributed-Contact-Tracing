Abstract

COVID-19 has increased the demand for contact tracing to unprecedented levels. The spreading virus could be averted by disrupting the chain of transmission. 
Contact tracing could be used as a preventive public health strategy to help control disease outbreaks like COVID-19.
This system approaches a distributed facial recognition system for COVID-19 contact tracking using an abundance of CCTV cameras and surveillance data. 
This system is capable of recording both past and real-time data.

The global spread of Covid-19 continues to provide a challenge for public health experts and governments alike to discover measures to regulate 
the disease's spread until a viable vaccine can be developed. This difficulty has prompted the development of new and innovative techniques, 
particularly in the use of technology. The use of security cameras in conjunction with facial recognition software is one of the most recent technology
applications to restrict the spread of the virus.

Facial recognition is a type of computer software that employs video content analysis (VCA) technology. 
VCA technology detects items inside a video image using machine learning and artificial intelligence and 
then extracts, identifies, classifies, and indexes them for a variety of applications.
